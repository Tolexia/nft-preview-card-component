# NFT preview card component 

This is a tiny project inspired by the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).  
The colors asked in the specifications were slightly different so I added a toggle switch from the ones asked to ones I prefered.
